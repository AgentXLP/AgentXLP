My name is Agent X in most places, Agent-11 is my kind of alternative name.

[![Agent's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=AgentXLP)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

Here are some facts about me:

- I was a lead developer for sm64ex-coop
- My favorite languages are C# and JavaScript
- I have background knowledge with using Unity
- My least favorite language is Java
- I like writing optimized code that looks good and runs fast

I am interested in 90s 3D graphics and games like DOOM, Quake, Half-Life or SM64 to name a few. Their underlying engines and ways they were programmed intrigue me a lot.
